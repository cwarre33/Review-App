# Lab 11: Online Review App

As part of my software development curriculum, I created an **Online Review App** using the Fetch API and a RESTful backend powered by `json-server`. This project reinforced my understanding of frontend-backend communication and key concepts in building dynamic, interactive web applications.

## Features Implemented

### 1. **REST API Integration**
- Established communication with a `json-server` backend to perform CRUD operations on review data.
- Demonstrated proficiency in making HTTP requests (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) using the Fetch API.

### 2. **Dynamic Rendering**
- Rendered statistical summaries and user-submitted reviews dynamically on the frontend.
- Enhanced user experience by visually updating the DOM without requiring page reloads.

### 3. **Form Handling**
- Captured user inputs to create, update, and delete reviews seamlessly.
- Validated form data for accuracy and completeness before submitting it to the server.

### 4. **Sorting Functionality**
- Implemented sorting of reviews based on user selection:
  - **Highest Rated**: Reviews sorted in descending order.
  - **Lowest Rated**: Reviews sorted in ascending order.
- Used event-driven programming to dynamically update the review display in response to user actions.

### 5. **Interactive User Interface**
- Incorporated features like:
  - Editable reviews with pre-filled forms.
  - Visual feedback for review ratings using icons.

## Key Skills Learned

### Frontend Development
- Mastered DOM manipulation techniques to create interactive and dynamic pages.
- Gained experience in handling asynchronous operations and updating the UI in real-time.

### Backend Communication
- Learned to construct API queries, handle JSON data, and effectively manage HTTP responses and errors.

### Debugging and Problem-Solving
- Gained deeper insights into troubleshooting issues during development, such as incorrect API calls or UI inconsistencies.

### Code Organization
- Improved understanding of maintaining a modular codebase by separating concerns between the frontend and backend.

## Reflection
This lab was an excellent opportunity to combine theoretical knowledge with practical implementation. It further developed my skills in full-stack development and reinforced the importance of building efficient, user-focused applications.

### Future Applications
The techniques and concepts I learned in this lab are foundational for building larger-scale projects and will be valuable for real-world software development scenarios.
